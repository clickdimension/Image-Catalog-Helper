# Image-Catalog-Helper
Create static image gallery alias catalog plus some other helper tools


/imgcat:

Python script with image cataloging options.
Mainly created to generate javascript file with a data array of information of image details, plus generation of thumbnails.
When the main index.html file is loaded into the browser, you can "browse" the directories, look at the thumbnails and see a bigger thumbnail on hover with some additional EXIF infos
When running the generator script you must indicate the origin folder and indicate or create the target folder for the thumbnails.
Currently supported image extensions: JPG

Other run - options:
- generate javascript list only (no thumbnails)
- clone empty directory tree
- resize all images 


/fotocalc:

Browser Page with Javascript for some photography calculations.
Currently: 
- Flash
- Macro
