# Image-Catalog-Helper
Create static image gallery alias catalog plus some other helper tools


/imgcat:

Python script with image cataloging options.
Main purpose of the script is to generate javascript files with data arrays of information of image details, plus generation of thumbnails. 

When running the generator script you must indicate the origin folder and select or create the target folder for the thumbnails.
Currently supported image extensions: JPG

Finally when the main index.html file is loaded into the browser, you can "browse" the directories, look at the image gallery of thumbnails and see a bigger thumbnail on hover with some additional EXIF infos


Other run - options:
- generate javascript list only (no thumbnails)
- clone empty directory tree
- resize all images of selected directory


/fotocalc:

Browser page with javascript for some photography calculations.

Currently: 
- Flash
- Macro
- Depth of field
